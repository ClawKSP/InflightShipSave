InflightShipSave

=========================


Saves a ship that is in-flight, in case you launched it and forgot to save.

When you want to save a ship, visit it in-flight and press F6. This will save the ship to a .craft file in your current game and will have the name "_Rescued" appended. 

===>  saves\[CurrentSaveName]\Ships\VAB\[NameOfShip]_Rescued.craft


NOTE: Still a work in progress. There are certain attributes about ships that, when active, cause the editor to throw NullRefs. Please let me know if you run into this, and provide a save and/or the offending .craft file.


Installation

============


Just place the InflightShipSave.dll in your GameData directory.
